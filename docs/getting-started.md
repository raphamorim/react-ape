This page will help you install and build your first React Ape app. If you already have used React Ape, you can skip ahead to the [Guides](components-and-apis).

## Starting from Zero

[React Ape Boilerplate](https://github.com/raphamorim/react-ape-boilerplate) is the easiest way to start building a new React Ape application. 

Assuming that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, you can clone the boilerplate using git and use npm to install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raphamorim/react-ape-boilerplate react-app

cd react-app
npm install && npm start
```
